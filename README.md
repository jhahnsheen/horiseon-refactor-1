# horiseon-refactor-1

This homework assignment consists of one html file and one css file. 
While the original code was certainly functional, it was redundant and disorganized. 
The files found in this repo are refactorizations of the original code.
Even with the addition of comment lines and spacing lines, the total number of lines in both files have decreased. 
The css file went from 200 lines of code to 137, although I'm sure that with more experience that number can be lowered even further.
The html file was transformed from a "div" heavy file to one that is structured and contains mostly semantic html tags. 
Extraneous classes were deleted and this simplified the css elements as well. 

The webpage, the landing page for a company by the name of Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc., looks and operates exactly the same as it had before, meaning the refactor was an overall success.
